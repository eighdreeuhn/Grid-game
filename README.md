#Number Tiles
##A side project developed during my General Assembly Software Engineering Immersive program
###I first wrote the logic for this game in high school on a TI-83 graphing calculator. After a few weeks in the GA program, once I felt comfortable enough with Javascript, I decided to tackle the problem again. After then learning React, I refactored the app to use React's functionality. I'm fairly happy with the results, especially the logic use to handle clicks on a tile that isn't next to the blank tile that handles moving an entire row or column at once. It was a much more difficult problem than I anticipated.
